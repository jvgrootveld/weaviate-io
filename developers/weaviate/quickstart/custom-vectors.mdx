As a vector database, Weaviate can do the vectorization for you using an inference provider (e.g. OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face), but it also lets you bring your own vectors. If you already have your vectors, performing a vector search with Weaviate looks like this:

1. Create a Weaviate instance
2. Authenticate to it
3. Import your data along with the custom vectors
4. Vectorize the query using your custom process
5. Perform a near vector search with Weaviate

## Data

We'll use as an example a tiny dataset consisting of 10 questions from the popular quiz show "Jeopardy!". Each object has an associated vector embedding, which was calculated using OpenAI. If your vectors have been generated by another inference provider, that's OK too - Weaviate has built-in modules for Cohere and Hugging Face.

## Installation

Weviate is open source and you can easily [run a local instance from a Docker](../installation/docker-compose.md) image on any OS, or even easier - you can create a free sandbox instance with the [Weaviate Cloud Services](../../wcs/quickstart.mdx) (WCS). Make sure to leave Authentication enabled, and while the instance is being created, read on!

## Client library

For the best experience with Weaviate, we recommend installing a Weaviate client library for one of these languages:

import CodeClientInstall from '/_includes/code/quickstart.clients.install.mdx';

<CodeClientInstall />

## Authentication

The recommended way to [authenticate](../configuration/authentication.md) to WCS is with an API key. Once the instance is ready, click on its <kbd>Details</kbd> button, then the key <kbd>ðŸ”‘</kbd> icon to access the API key:

import WCSGetKey from '../../wcs/guides/img/wcs-get-key.png';

<img src={WCSGetKey} width="100%" alt="Instance configuration"/>

Grab the "Admin" key. You'll need it later for the client instantiation, which looks like this:

import WCSAuthenticationApiKey from '/_includes/code/wcs.authentication.api.key.mdx';

<WCSAuthenticationApiKey/>

## Schema

Weaviate lets you define vectorizers at the class level, with further control at the property level. Since you're bringing your own vectors, we'll set `vectorizer: "none"`. TODO

## Import data with vectors

Here is the set of [10 pre-vectorized Jeopardy questions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weaviate-tutorials/quickstart/main/data/jeopardy_tiny.json) in JSON format. We'll import them into Weaviate using a batcher, which adds some complexity but offers maximum performance for large data sets as well:

TODO: ask the user to download, instead of to install node-fetch? (see github.com/weaviate/weaviate-edu-team-tasks/issues/39)

import ImportQuestionsWithVectors from '/_includes/code/quickstart.import.questions+vectors.mdx'

<ImportQuestionsWithVectors />

## Query

Let's say you want to find questions related to biology. First you'll have to obtain your custom vector for "biology". Then, pass that vector to the `nearVector` parameter:

TODO: TypeScript + await

import NearVector from '/_includes/code/quickstart.query.nearVector.mdx';

<NearVector />

You should see something like this:

import BiologyQuestionsJson from '/_includes/code/quickstart.biology.questions.mdx';

<BiologyQuestionsJson />

## Putting it together

The following code puts it all together, taking care of everything from schema definition to data import to query. Remember to replace the endpoint and Weaviate key.

TODO: append the query code

import ByovAll from '/_includes/code/quickstart.byov.all.mdx'

<ByovAll />
